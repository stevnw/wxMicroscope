#### Camera Specs

<b>Product description:</b> 

- Focus Range: from 1mm to 250mm
- Frame Rate: Max 30f/s under 600 Lux Brightness
- Magnification Ratio: 40x to 1000x

<b>Real(er) specs:</b>

I think its much shittier than this - the 1000x magnification is a very comical claim. Its more of a focusing wheel than a zoom.

The resolution is 640x480 (I believe 0.3 Megapixel ?) - magnification is in practice is only around 40x - 50x (very generous rounding up)

I think I will need to triple check this, but my assumed maths is 40x the fov is ~ 11mm x 8mm with an actual magnification of ~15x ???



- this is generally the best I can get focused
